# Machine Learning for Transient Science (MALTS) Topical Team
---

The Machine Learning for Transient Science (MALTS) Topical Team within DESC is committed to the advancement of statistical tools for studying the variable sky. With the advent of the Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey for Space and Timestarting in 2024, automated approaches to data anlysis will become increasingly valuable. At our tri-weekly meetings, we aim to discuss new papers in the field, offer tutorials for popular ML methods, and highlight current ML-oriented projects within DESC.

If you have a question about the group, please reach out to co-leads Alex Gagliano (gaglian2@illinois.edu) or Benjamin Remy (benjamin.remy@cea.fr).
